  "description": "A conversation inside of a bot can contain one or more dialogs. A dialog is designed to be a self-contained set of interactions to collect information from a user, or perform an action on her behalf. The bot maintains a stack of dialogs, meaning that as each one completes, it's popped off the stack, and control returns to the one prior. You can add dialogs to the stack by calling `session.beginDialog` or `session.replaceDialog`, and ended by using `session.endDialog` or `session.endDialogWithResult`.",
